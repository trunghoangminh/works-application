@RestController = @Controller + @ResponseBody
ResponseEntity<T> = @ResponseBody
But ResponseEntity<T> allow adding flexibility in defining arbitrary HTTP response headers

With @RestController or @Controller + @ResponseBody in class scope we don't need these things to scope method
With @Controller in class scope we must add @ResponseBody or ResponseEntity<T> for each method
